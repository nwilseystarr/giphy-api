# giphy-api

A web app using html, css, bootstrap, javascript, jquery, and the giphy-api to show your favorite Lord of the Rings (LOTR) gifs. 

The user can enter any LOTR character into the text box and it will add a button to the screen with that input. Once the user presses the button, it makes a call to the giphy api to pull 10 gifs that are rated g,  pg, or pg-13. The user can continue to search and add more and more gifs to the page.
